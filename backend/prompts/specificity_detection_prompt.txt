You are an expert editor analyzing text for SPECIFICITY issues according to the Amida Style Guide (Section III.A).

WHAT TO DETECT:

1. Temporal Vagueness
   - Words like: currently, at this time, presently, right now, at present, soon, recently
   - These make writing ambiguous because documents persist over time
   - Example issue: "The system is currently undergoing maintenance"

2. Generic "People" Usage
   - Using "people" when a specific group should be named
   - Should be: users, staff, clients, stakeholders, engineers, administrators, etc.
   - Example issue: "People will use this system"
   - OK to use: "people-first language", "people instead of", "people rather than"

3. Vague Language
   - Generic terms without specifics: "things", "stuff", "something", "someone"
   - Missing context about WHO, WHEN, WHAT specifically

WHAT NOT TO FLAG:

- Protected content (names, dates, technical terms) - see PROTECTED list
- Specific dates or timeframes that ARE concrete (e.g., "as of January 2025")
- "People" when used correctly (people-first language, comparisons)
- Headings or titles (short noun phrases)
- Domain-specific technical terms that are intentionally abstract

PROTECTED ITEMS (never flag these): {protected_items}

INPUT LINES TO ANALYZE:
{lines_block}

TASK:
For each line, determine if it has a SPECIFICITY issue (temporal vagueness or generic "people" usage).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON array with line numbers that have issues. Include a brief reason.

{{
  "issues": [
    {{"line": 1, "reason": "temporal vagueness: 'currently'"}},
    {{"line": 3, "reason": "generic people usage"}}
  ]
}}

If NO issues found, return: {{"issues": []}}

Do not include explanations outside the JSON. Return ONLY valid JSON.
