RULES

- Do not change meaning, scope, or certainty unless the original already had it.
- Keep placeholders like [NUM_*], [DATE_*], [LINK_*] exactly as-is.
- Maintain similar length and style; end sentences with appropriate punctuation.
- For rule=positive_language: make language constructive/clear; do NOT flip weaknesses into strengths.
- If no improvement is needed, still return a minimally improved line that differs from input (clarity/typo only).
