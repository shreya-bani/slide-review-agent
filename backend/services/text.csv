State Market Trends and Challenges
Across the State health IT ecosystem, there is a clear focus on cost containment, improved data access, and enhanced quality of care. This includes 
a shift toward value-based care models, the expansion of Medicaid coverage, addressing social determinants of health to improve healthcare access 
and equity, investments in public health data infrastructure, the establishment of data governance frameworks, and improved data interoperability.
Key trends in the State sector:
•
CMS compliance mandates – States must comply with 
the Interoperability and Patient Access (9115-F) and 
Interoperability and Prior Authorization (0057-F) Final 
Rules by January 1, 2027
•
Healthcare reforms – Policies emphasize choice, 
expanded access to care, and cost reduction, including 
initiatives such as price transparency and value-based 
care (e.g., AFPI white papers, Make America Healthy 
Again initiative)
•
Advancement of digital health and interoperability –
Efforts focus on improving quality of care through 
disease surveillance, outbreak response, and enhanced 
data-sharing (e.g., TEFCA Initiative – ONC)
•
IT modernization – Investment in modern, modular, 
cloud-based systems drives public health data 
infrastructure improvements (e.g., HIMSS Public Health 
Information and Technology Infrastructure 
Modernization Initiative, CDC Data Modernization 
Initiative)
•
Federal assistance program spending pause – On 
January 27, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) issued a memo pausing all federal assistance 
program spending (inclusive of grants to states), except 
for direct financial assistance initiatives (e.g., Social 
Security, Medicare, FEMA individual assistance)
•
State agencies require the ability to improve or re-
engineer manual, time-intensive processes through the 
incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ML, data 
mining, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and 
automation capabilities to increase operational and 
oversight efficiencies
•
State health agencies must implement data standards 
(e.g., FHIR, HL7) to achieve federal interoperability 
requirements, enhance quality of care services (and the 
overall patient experience), optimize data aggregation 
and analysis across populations, and better-address 
health disparities
•
As states transition to a Medicaid Managed Care model, 
they require visibility into claim-related encounters 
transferred between providers and health plans, to 
better understand how Managed Care Organizations 
process and adjudicate claims and to ensure accurate 
and efficient provider reimbursement
•
To modernize legacy IT environments, states can no 
longer afford to modify existing monolithic systems and 
are shifting to best-of-breed modular solutions that can 
be implemented and integrated cost-effectively 
•
Grant program efficiency may be impacted by a potential 
funding pause due to the OMB memo
•
Data silos and fragmentation limit interoperability, 
preventing a comprehensive view of patient profiles, 
trend analysis, and quality/cost assessment
•
Redundant, incomplete, and poor-quality data sets hinder 
access to accurate, data-driven healthcare insights
•
A lack of data standards, interoperability issues, and 
incomplete patient records across state systems 
contribute to inefficiencies, increased costs, and risks to 
patient safety
•
The legacy Medicaid Management Information System 
(MMIS) and outdated systems prevent effective analysis 
of complex data sets, limiting the insights needed to 
improve care quality and operational efficiency
•
An absence of data governance frameworks leads to 
inconsistent data management practices, security risks, 
and challenges in meeting data privacy regulations (e.g., 
HIPAA, CMS)

NCDHHS: Medicaid Connect – API Development and Implementation
State, 2024–Present
Problem
Over 100 million Americans with digital health records cannot access or share medical 
information across healthcare systems. To address this fragmentation, CMS mandated that 
state Medicaid agencies implement APIs for secure electronic exchange of healthcare data 
between patients, caretakers, providers, and payers.
Our Approach
Amida, in partnership with MedicaSoft and LexisNexis, is building a comprehensive 
Medicaid Connect platform for NCDHHS that includes:
•
Patient Access and Payer-to-Payer APIs built on MedicaSoft's HITRUST-certified 
NXT Platform
•
Remote identity verification through LexisNexis integration
•
A Provider Directory API that enables beneficiaries to search for caregivers using their 
preferred third-party applications
Impact
The Medicaid Connect platform will directly address healthcare data fragmentation through:
•
Access to seventeen FHIR resources with claims and medical data for 1.1 million NC 
Medicaid Direct beneficiaries
•
Provider Directory access for all 10.8 million North Carolina residents
•
Complete NCDHHS compliance with CMS interoperability mandates via secure, FHIR-
based APIs without the need for direct NCDHHS personnel interaction
Amida leveraged our expertise in health data 
interoperability to extract data from NCDHHS 
systems and convert it into FHIR-compliant 
resources. Through Medicaid Connect, North 
Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries will gain secure 
online access to their health data.

Problem
The Encounter Processing System (EPS) for the South Carolina 
Department of Health and Human Services (SCDHHS) 
was outdated and inadequate. It failed to meet critical business, 
technical, and functional needs. The SCDHHS EPS utilized a 
mainframe as its runtime environment, which proved to be an 
inflexible, expensive solution that was unable to scale.
Our Approach
Amida deployed a Minimum Testable Product (MTP), which was an 
enhanced and modernized iteration of the Virginia EPS application 
architecture, technology stack, and code base. The EPS MTP 
includes critical components such as encounter ingestion, storage, 
validation, and processing, as well as ancillary features such as 
reporting and distribution. In close collaboration with SCDHHS, we 
implemented the solution on the AWS cloud, which allowed us to 
maximize flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while 
adhering to industry standards and best practices.
Impact
A majority (65 percent) of all South Carolina Medicaid Program 
beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans, which account 
for more than $3 billion in costs annually. The new EPS can handle 
a full month’s Medicaid encounter volume – more than a million 
encounters – in just one day. In the future, the new EPS will 
improve data quality for rate setting by 95 percent.

This diagram depicts the FHIR-to-OMOP translation 
process workflow. Data from A (source: Athenahealth) 
will be retrieved in FHIR/FHIR-compliant format via SFTP 
from B (Amida's mapping service) and then transported to 
C (destination: WVCTSI-controlled OMOP database).
Problem
WVCTSI received a five-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to increase 
the participation of underserved populations (e.g., minority and low-income groups) in 
clinical trials through partnerships with local clinics. The institute employs skilled clinicians 
and researchers but lacks the technical resources required to establish bidirectional 
connections with partner clinics, which is necessary to access, map, and translate patient 
health data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) model. This model 
enables seamless data sharing and utilization for research purposes.
Our Approach
WVCTSI selected Amida to provide mapping, translation, and data-loading services. We are 
working with WVCTSI and two partner clinic sites – the New River Health Association and 
Cabin Creek Health System, which serve a population of approximately 36,000 patients – to 
retrieve health data from Athenahealth, their current data source, via bulk FHIR file transfer. 
The retrieved data is specific to ZIP code, Body Mass Index (BMI), and Hemoglobin-A1C 
levels for patients over five years of age. Amida translates the FHIR-based Athenahealth 
records to the WVCTSI OMOP format.
Impact
Amida's approach to the retrieval, mapping, and translation of FHIR data to OMOP 
standards improves data interoperability and collaboration among researchers and clinicians, 
which enables informed data analysis and business decision-making.
Our translation service streamlines data-format conversion, minimizing time, effort, and 
costs while preventing data loss and errors caused by manual interventions. The 
standardization of institutional data for seamless collaboration between clinical and research 
teams will improve patient outcomes.

Diagram of the BIDP conceptual architecture.
Problem
Health data for citizens of North Carolina is distributed across 
fourteen governmental divisions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the state built a consolidation platform that enables policymakers 
and public health officials to monitor outbreaks and deploy 
resources. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human 
Services (NCDHHS) asked Amida to help fortify the platform and 
extend its data ingestion capabilities.
Our Approach
Amida developed use cases, identified the technology stack, and 
implemented a fully functional proof-of-concept. We conducted a 
systematic technical review and recommended a new data flow 
architecture. We implemented that pipeline with:
•
A renovated flow architecture, including source identification, 
ingestion and staging, model reconciliation, and transformation
•
Data governance capabilities and tools (e.g., metadata 
management and a data catalog)
•
The ability to onboard additional data sources and support 
future use cases 
•
High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR)
Impact
We developed a fully functional and production-ready proof-of-

The SPPG is a plugin for the i2b2 platform. Any user 
of the i2b2 platform (or member of the ACT network) 
can install the plugin and generate synthetic data.
Problem
Researchers and educators use clinical data in many scenarios beyond 
direct patient care, such as population health analytics and training. 
When patient data is transmitted and stored for use in the systems 
that support these activities, the risk of HIPAA violations due to 
improper use or disclosure increases. To minimize the risk of patient 
confidentiality breaches, organizations should avoid the use of real 
patient data whenever possible.
Our Approach
Amida’s Synthetic Patient Profile Generator creates artificial patient 
data that is statistically similar enough to real data for use in non-care 
systems, but that is not attributable to real patients. The tool is 
integrated into the University of Pittsburgh’s informatics platform, 
i2b2. It analyzes a sample cohort of real patients, statistically profiles 
the demographics, diagnoses, and care plans of those patients, and 
generates a similar cohort of synthetic patients. Synthetic patient data 
is free of security concerns and can be widely distributed, but it is also 
realistic enough for use in analytics and training.
Impact
By providing wider access to statistically valid data sets that do not 
require elaborate HIPAA protections or consent tracking, synthetic 
patient data will become an indispensable tool for clinical training.

Problem
Availity needed a more efficient way to query existing patient records for 
specific health conditions or cases. It was a cumbersome and slow 
process to find records and determine patients who matched important 
criteria.
Our Approach
Amida helped Availity and HCSC to retrieve, parse, store, and expose C-
CDA clinical data via an API. We worked with individual C-CDAs to:
•
Design an easy-to-use web application to search the C-CDAs with a 
predefined list of data elements; these C-CDAs are tailored for 
specific customer needs, such as Healthcare Effectiveness Data and 
Information Set (HEDIS) measurements and risk adjustment
•
Build microservices that can parse a stream of C-CDAs from one or 
more sources of clinical data, and index and store them for 
subsequent retrieval by a web application
•
Develop an API to expose clinical data to the HCSC Medical 
Economics team’s third-party applications
Impact
Rapid access to health information (such as population-health and clinical 
data needed to generate HEDIS scores) supports patient risk 
management, enhances care, lowers costs, and improves health 
outcomes.

A representation of Amida’s proof-of-concept 
use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help 
state tax agencies improve audit compliance.
Problem
State tax agencies need better IT systems to more successfully expose non-
compliance, minimize zero-dollar assessments (false positives), and prioritize 
audit leads based on the probability of successful recoupment.
Our Approach
Amida is helping the SAS Institute build custom tax collection applications for 
their statistical software suite. We are developing a proof-of-concept that 
focuses on business and sales tax collection. Our work involves: 
•
An analytical approach (that uses tax-type scenarios) and an areas-of-
intrigue approach (that employs custom-built algorithms based on the 
business sector)
•
Entity resolution to identify anomalies in complex data sources that indicate 
likely tax avoidance, such as a business with purchases but no sales
•
Trend analysis based on prior filings, and models that rapidly project the 
cost of audits (typically in a matter of hours)
•
Scalable in-memory analytical processing, integrated data mining, and 
modern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the development and 
continual improvement of audit and compliance models 
Impact
State agencies can achieve increased rates of audit compliance and recoupment.

Compliance with congressionally-mandated reports requires the 
aggregation, transformation, and re-formatting of millions of 
claims and membership records. Errors in submissions can be 
costly, requiring additional man-hours to investigate the cause, 
correct the issue, and re-compile the submission packages.
Amida designed a data integrity overlay to facilitate compliance

SearchBlox integration architecture 
for the Virginia Tax system.
Problem
The Virginia Department of Taxation’s (Virginia Tax’s) search system failed to consistently 
provide accurate and relevant results to users seeking information on tax regulations. The 
absence of a dynamic search capability made it difficult for users to locate specific content 
quickly. As a result, they had to perform time-consuming manual searches across various 
sections of the Virginia Tax Laws, Rules, and Decisions (LRD), which further hindered the timely 
retrieval of vital information.
Our Approach
Amida implemented the SearchBlox Enterprise Search solution to enhance search 
functionalities for the Virginia Tax system. We configured and optimized SearchBlox to enable 
a more intuitive search experience, allowing users to easily access relevant tax-related content. 
We tailored the integration to align seamlessly with Virginia Tax’s existing infrastructure, 
ensuring minimal disruption.
Impact
Implementation of the SearchBlox solution significantly improved the Virginia Tax system in the 
following ways:
•
Improved search accuracy – Users now have access to a dynamic search platform that 
delivers precise results for tax laws, rules, and decisions
•
Streamlined information access – The new solution offers advanced filtering options that 
allow users to refine search results by year, topic, and type, which reduces the time it takes 
to find specific information
•
Enhanced user experience – Features such as SmartSuggest help users to quickly locate 
frequently accessed content, which improves navigation and overall efficiency

Problem
The shift to cloud computing has introduced complex challenges in data 
management as organizations face decentralized control over their data. 
Different teams and departments often employ disparate approaches to 
data integration, security, and governance, even when they rely on shared 
data sources or endpoints. This inconsistency is compounded by the 
coexistence of outdated file formats and a variety of data exchange 
protocols (e.g., real-time, near-real-time, asynchronous, batch), leading to 
operational inefficiencies and data misalignment.
Our Approach
Amida’s Enterprise Integration Platform is a low-code solution designed to 
streamline data exchange, both within organizations and with their external 
partners. By providing scalable, modular data pipelines with built-in audit 
trails and monitoring, the EIP reduces operational costs and accelerates 
deployment timelines. 
Impact
The EIP offers a centralized, elastic, and secure framework for data receipt, 
transmission, and transformation across organizational boundaries. This 
centralization reduces or eliminates redundancy, simplifies data processing, 
and standardizes cleansing and conversion. Its cloud-based design enables 
scalability for each applicable component of the solution architecture. 
Robust EIP security measures ensure the integrity of all transactions and 
provide authentication, authorization, and delivery guarantees, as well as 
transaction-level auditability for compliance and administration.

Problem
The Encounter Processing System (EPS) validates encounters between 
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and State Medicaid Agencies 
(SMAs). Current solutions often use mainframes, which limit scalability, 
flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. These constraints hinder efficient and 
accurate encounter processing and frequently result in poor data quality.
Our Approach
To address the challenges of poor data quality and inefficient validation 
processes, Amida’s EPS will provide SMAs with a modular, cost-effective 
solution based on a Business Rules Engine (BRE). The EPS will ensure 
that the encounter data validation process begins with an assessment of 
the Electronic Data Interchange’s (EDI’s) compliance with the business 
rules of a particular SMA.
Impact
Amida's EPS will support high-volume encounter processing for SMAs, 
handling more than a million transactions per day to significantly 
enhance operational efficiency. The system will incorporate 
approximately 250 customizable business rules and store about 95 
percent of incoming EDI data in a relational database to ensure data 
integrity and compliance.
This solution is expected to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and 
efficiency of encounter-data processing and MCO provider-rate setting 
by 90 percent. In turn, these enhancements will lead to better patient 
outcomes, reduce processing costs by 80 percent, and elevate the 
overall quality of care for Medicaid agencies and their beneficiaries.

Problem
Prior authorization (PA) is a widely used healthcare cost management 
process among payer organizations. However, current PA methods are 
often time-consuming and burdensome, leading to significant treatment 
delays, increased healthcare costs, and suboptimal patient outcomes. To 
address these challenges and improve access to healthcare data, the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the Interoperability and 
PA Final Rule (CMS-0057-F).1
Approach
Amida’s Prior Authorization Support solution is based on the Da Vinci 
Implementation Guides (IGs) for PA. Our application automates the 
authorization process by leveraging FHIR resources to pre-populate 
customized questionnaires with patient-specific data, enabling near-real-
time information exchange between payers and providers.
Impact
•
Save time in filling out required forms and eliminate 100 percent of 
user-induced errors in key data fields 
•
Reduce PA response times to under seventy-two hours for urgent cases 
and seven calendar days for standard cases
•
Enable close to real-time tracking of PA metrics and response status, 
minimizing reliance on phone calls
•
Ensure HL7-FHIR standards of interoperability
•
Through increased automation, flexibility, and transparency our solution 
reduces the burden on all healthcare entities involved in the PA process

Problem
Many healthcare payers and providers cannot leverage their data to 
proactively improve quality of care. 
Our Approach
Saraswati enables dynamic HEDIS score calculation based on near-real-
time healthcare data. Rather than wait for static calculations that are 
typically evaluated quarterly or annually, payers and providers can use 
these streaming insights to consistently assess and improve quality of 
care. Saraswati:
•
Links to existing infrastructure pipelines to ingest healthcare data 
from a range of mechanisms (e.g., REST, Amazon S3, and Smart on 
FHIR) in a variety of formats (FHIR, CCD, HL7, and X12)
•
Calculates electronic Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM) scores based 
on a static data set using National Committee for Quality Assurance 
(NCQA)-certified measurements, and then dynamically recalculates 
HEDIS scores based on streaming data
•
Uses time-series ML algorithms (via Python and PySpark) to predict 
trends in scores, which it displays in a dashboard that enables 
providers to intervene early on potential issues
Impact
Near-real-time HEDIS score calculations enable payers and providers to 
proactively identify services that need attention and quickly intervene to 
improve patient outcomes.
