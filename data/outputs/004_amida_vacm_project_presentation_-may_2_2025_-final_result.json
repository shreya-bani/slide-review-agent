These embeddings are then reduced to two dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), allowing for normalized visualization. Subsequently, the Voronoi methodology is applied, which partitions the 2D space based on Euclidean distances. Each seed point (ECFR description) becomes the center of a region, and all data points (ICD-10 code descriptions) within a region are closer to that seed point than to any other. This technique effectively clusters and organizes the data points around their respective seed points.",

Vector embeddings are generated for ICD-10 code descriptions and stored in a FAISS index utilizing IndexFlatL2, which relies on L2 norm (Euclidean distance) for similarity searches. During the retrieval process, an embedding is generated for the input query and compared with the stored embeddings to retrieve the top k results. The retrieval process is configured with k=500, the top 500 most relevant ICD-10 codes are retained based on similarity ranking. Analysis shows that only 29 of the ICD-10 codes matched within the top 500 results, leaving 118 ICD-10 codes unretrieved. Since the generation process in RAG relies on the retrieved data, any missing codes in the retrieval stage are inherently excluded from the generation phase. This dependency emphasizes that the quality and completeness of the retrieved data directly impact the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the generated results. Without retrieving all relevant codes, the generated output may fail to capture the full scope of the input query, making the current RAG approach insufficient.",

In total, there are approximately seventy-three,500 data points representing vector embeddings of ICD-10 code descriptions. To analyze the data, Voronoi partitioning was applied using Euclidean distance. This method assigns each data point to the nearest seed point by calculating the Euclidean distance between the data point and the seed points. This approach helps identify patterns and relationships between ECFR descriptions and their closest seed points, offering a structured way to group similar data. By analyzing these groupings, we gain insights into the relevance of each seed point to the ICD-10 codes, uncovering how medical conditions are distributed and interconnected based on their descriptions.",

During the retrieval process, an embedding is generated for the input query and compared with the stored embeddings to retrieve the top k results. The retrieval process is configured with k=500, the top 500 most relevant ICD-10 codes are retained based on similarity ranking. Analysis shows that only 29 of the ICD-10 codes matched within the top 500 results, leaving 118 ICD-10 codes unretrieved.
